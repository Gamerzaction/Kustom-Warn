KustomWarn allows you to warn a misbehaving player whilst stating the reason for the warning. The player that is being warned will receive a message informing them that they have been warned and what for whilst the person warning them will receive a confirmation message informing them that the player has received his/her warning (even if the command is sent from the console). The warning will then be logged to Warnings.log. This is so that you may keep track of any warnings that have been issued on your server. The information that gets logged includes the date and time of the warning, who was warned by who and what for. The reason can contain more than one word.<br /><br />
